Install the Arduino IDE on your computer, compile the "Blink" example, upload the example to the board, and ensure that the LED blinks. Turn in 2 screen shots of the Arduino IDE. The first screen shot should show the "Done compiling" message & the byte number information in the message area. The second screen shot should show the message area after successfully uploading the sketch.
